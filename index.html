                There are numerous different voting systems, each with many variations.
                Our group wanted to see how different voting systems would change the outcome of the
                <b>2000 Presidential Election</b>. However before we can do that, we need
                to explain how each voting system works.

              <p class="content-text">
                To start out, it is important to note that on election day, you aren't
                voting for who you support as President and Vice President. You are voting
                for individuals who then in turn cast their electoral vote to their respective
                candidates. That is the essence of the Electoral College; <b>you vote for electors
                who will vote for a party's candidates</b>.<a href="#fn-1" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
              </p>
            </div>

            <!--Would be sweet to make the number of electoral votes appear on the centroid-->
            <div id="ss-2" class="content-section">
              <h1 class="content-title">Electoral Votes Equals Number of Electors</h1>
              <p class="content-text">
                <b>The number of electoral votes that each state has corresponds to how many
                electoral voters a party can receive</b>. Washington State for example has eleven electoral votes
                meaning that there are eleven electors for the different parties in
                an election that will cast their electoral votes to their party.<a href="#fn-2" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
                Each state's number of electors is determined by adding the number of senators (always two)
                plus their number of representatives.
              </p>

              <h1 class="content-title">Pick One, Only One</h1>
              <p class="content-text">
                On election day, this isn't too important to the average voter. What
                is shown to each voter is a ballot that asks them to <b>pick the party that has
                the candidates they would like to see President and Vice President</b>, and
                pick only one party.

              <h1 class="content-title">Winner Gets State's Electoral Votes</h1>
              <p class="content-text">
                After the popular votes from each voter are counted, each state then has the
                electors from the winning party, <b>the party with highest percentage popular vote, cast their votes to the electoral college</b>.
                In this way, we see a 'winner takes all' system.

              <p class="content-text">
                This process happens in each state across the country. Each slate of electors
                casts their votes and <b>the winner of the election is determined as soon as
                a party receives over 50% of the electoral votes</b>, or 270 electoral votes.<a href="#fn-3" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[3]</sup></a>

            <p class="content-text">
              It is important to note that while FPTP has its benefits as a voting system,
              mainly being that it is quick, easy, decently proportional, and commonly
              produces centrist policies. FPTP also has rather large negative side
              effects associated with it.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              First Past the Post has been repeatedly shown to converge to a two party
              system over multiple election cycles.<a href="#fn-4" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[4]</sup></a> For example, if there were multiple
              parties in an election, the members from the lowest
              winning party might feel that their votes were wasted whereupon a party that
              they didn't want to win, won. Because of this, they will vote in the next election with
              the highest winning party that most resembles their party values - in order to at least
              have a decent say in the way that they think the country should head.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              This cycle of the lowest winning party adding their votes to the highest winning party -                 that they most align with - repeats until there are a very limited number of parties (usually two parties) left
              that represent the wide range of individuals in the country. This is what also
              forces FPTP to form centrist policies. With only two parties, each party has
              to cater to a large, non-homogeneous group of the population, so that each party has
              to form centrist policies to make sure they have a chance at winning
              again in the next election cycle.

                ballots that votes for said party and assign their vote to their second party
                choice</b>. If no party receives over 50% of the newly counted
                vote, this step repeats until a winner is found. Sometimes this process can end with more than two parties however
                in our example it ends with <b>the Democratic Party controlling Oregon with over 50% of the popular vote</b>.<a href="#fn-5" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[5]</sup></a>

            <p class="content-text">
              Unlike FPTP, Alternate Vote is extremely costly. When no winner is immediately shown,
              checking the lowest winning party votes again for each step of the recursion can be
              time consuming.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              Alternate Vote has a few benefits, however. Many consider the greatest benefit to be that
              individual voters don't have to worry about who their neighbor is voting for.
              The problem of votes not mattering doesn't occur in Alternate Vote. If a voter's first
              ranked party doesn't win, it may be their second, or third, or ... favorite party.
              It additionally means that fringe votes that know they have very different opinions from
              the rest of the population can still vote without worrying that their voice doesn't have a say.

              Supplementary Vote is a sort of middle ground between the two voting systems - quicker and

              can also lead to two parties becoming incredibly close and creating first and second
              choice parties for individuals with similar beliefs that are resistant to change.

            <p class="content-text">
              The goal of this visualization was to show that First Past the Post isn't the only voting system
              available, and secondly, there may be better, more accurate proportional voting system available.
              Alternate Vote and Supplementary Vote both produce Democrats as the winner instead of Republicans, different from the original First Past the Post system.
              Is this bad? While we can't answer such a broad question, it is important to note that the Democratic
              Party lost in the 2000 Election even when the final vote showed that they had the higher percentage of
              total national popular vote. We leave this as an opened ended question. Should we stay with First Past
              the Post or try to switch to a different voting system?

              A party's candidate may have extraneous circumstances in which it is important
              to still allow the electors to vote for another candidate. Additionally, this
              allows for faithless electors. More detail available in the sources.

              can lead to candidates having a higher total popular vote but less electoral vote,

            <li id="fn-4">While this is shown in numerous examples, there are also counter examples
              that show that FPTP doesn't always necessarily converge to two parties. However in
              those examples, the parties it does converge is usually less than 4, which is still
              drastically less than other systems commonly have. <a href="#ss-4" class="fn-back transition-all-100">^</a></li>

              (Nader and Independent have separate interests in who they would have voted for). From this we can split the
              other party votes into Democratic and Republican votes. This
              is obviously not the ideal example however it does help show how drastically third party candidates can affect the
              outcome of an election. <a href="#ss-5" class="fn-back transition-all-100">^</a></li>
            <li id="fn-6">Technically this is the same step as in AV due to our simplification of polling numbers between Independents and Nader voters.
              Ideally this would produce different data however for our visualization we feel it works out to be about the same. <a href="#ss-6" class="fn-back transition-all-100">^</a></li></li>
