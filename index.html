                2To start out, it is important to note that on election day, you aren't
                voting for who you support as President and Vice President. You are voting
                for individuals who then in turn cast their electoral vote to their respective
                candidates. That is the essence of the Electoral College; <b>you vote for electors
                who will vote for a party's candidates</b>.<a href="#fn-1" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[1]</sup></a>

              <p class="content-text">
                <b>3The number of electoral votes that each state has corresponds to how many
                electoral voters a party can receive</b>. Washington State has twelve electoral votes
                meaning that there are twelve electors for the different parties in
                an election that will cast their electoral votes to their party.<a href="#fn-2" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[2]</sup></a>
                Each state's number of electors is determined by adding the number of senators (2)
                plus their number of representatives.

                4On election day, this isn't too important to the average voter. What
                is shown to each voter is a ballot that asks them to <b>pick the party that has
                the candidates they would like to see President and Vice President</b>, and
                pick only one party.

                5After the popular votes from each voter are counted, each state then has the
                electors from the winning party, <b>the party with more than 50% of the popular vote, cast their votes to the electoral college</b>.
                In this way, we see a 'winner takes all' system.

              7It is important to note that while FPTP has its benefits as a voting system,
              mainly being that it is quick, easy, decently proportional, and commonly
              produces centrist policies. FPTP also has rather large negative side
              effects associated with it.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              8First Past the Post has been repeatedly shown to converge to a two party
              system over multiple election cycles.<a href="#fn-4" class="fn-toward transition-all-100"><sup>[4]</sup></a> For example, if there were multiple
              parties in an election, like in the first small multiple below, the members from the lowest
              winning party might feel that their votes were wasted whereupon a party that
              they didn't want to win, won. Because of this, they will vote in the next year with
              the highest winning party that most resembles their party values - in order to at least
              have a decent say in the way that they think the country should head.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              9This cycle of the lowest winning party adding their votes to the highest winning party -                 that they most align with - repeats until there are a very limited number of parties (usually two parties) left
              that represent the wide range of individuals in the country. This is what also
              forces FPTP to form centrist policies. With only two parties, each party has
              to cater to a large, non-homogeneous group of the population, so that each party has
              to form centrist policies to make sure they have a chance at winning
              again in the next election cycle.

                the Alternate Vote. So like before, in our system, you would be voting for

            <p class="content-text">
              Unlike FPTP, Alternate Vote is extremely costly. When no winner is immediately shown,
              checking the lowest winning party votes again for each step of the recursion can be
              time consuming.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              Alternate Vote has a few benefits, however. Many consider the greatest benefit to be that
              individual voters don't have to worry about who their neighbor is voting for.
              The problem of votes not mattering doesn't occur in Alternate Vote. If a voter's first
              ranked party doesn't win, it may be their second, or third, or ... favorite party.
              It additionally means that fringe votes that know they have very different opinions from
              the rest of the population can still vote without worrying that their voice doesn't have a say.

                The differing point from Alternate Vote to Supplementary Vote occurs here. Instead of

                choices. Even if no party has over 50% of the popular vote, we assign the

            <p class="content-text">
              Supplementary Vote is a sort of middle ground between the two voting systems - quicker and
              cheaper while also allowing for voters to feel valuable. However, this system
              can also lead to two parties becoming incredibly close and creating first and second
              choice parties for individuals with similar beliefs that are resistant to change.

            <li id="fn-1">Electors are important to the process because they allow for change.
              A party's candidate may have extraneous circumstances in which it is important
              to still allow the electors to vote for another candidate. Additionally, this
              allows for faithless electors. More detail available in the sources.

            <li id="fn-3">Popular vote for state winning and electoral vote for election winning
              can lead to candidates having a higher total popular vote but less electoral vote,
              thus losing the election. Our data, for example, shows how Gore won the popular vote but lost
              the electoral vote. <a href="#ss-3" class="fn-back transition-all-100">^</a></li>
            <li id="fn-4">While this is shown in numerous examples, there are also counter examples
              that show that FPTP doesn't always necessarily converge to two parties. However in
              those examples, the parties it does converge is usually less than 4, which is still
              drastically less than other systems commonly have. <a href="#ss-4" class="fn-back transition-all-100">^</a></li>
