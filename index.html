                There are numerous different voting systems, each with many variations.
                Our group wanted to see how each voting system would change the outcome of the
                <b>2000 Presidential Election</b>. However before we can do that, we need
                to explain how each voting system works.
              </p>

              <p class="content-text">
                Of the many, this visualization will explain the process of the
                <b>electoral college and first-past-the-post</b>, <b>supplimentary vote</b>, and
                <b>alternate vote</b>.

              <h1>The Electoral College and<br>First Past the Post</h1>
              <p class="content-text">
                To start out, it is important to note that on election day, people aren't
                voting for who they support as President and Vice President, they are voting
                for people whom then in turn cast their electoral vote to their respective
                candidates. That is the essence of the Electoral College; you vote for electors
                who will vote for are pledged to a parties candidates.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
              <p class="content-text">
                This is important because the number of electoral votes each state has
                corresponds to how many electoral voters they have. Washington State has
                twelve electoral votes, this means that there are twelve electors for the
                different parties in an election that will cast their electoral votes to
                their party.
              </p>
            </div>

            <div class="content-section">
              <p class="content-text">
                On election day this isn't too important to the average voter however. What
                is shown to each voter is a ballot that asks them to pick the party that has
                the candidates they would like to see President and Vice President, and
                pick only one party.

            <div class="content-section">
              <p class="content-text">
                After the popular votes from each voter is counted, each state then has the
                electors from the winning party, the party with more than 50% of the popular vote,
                cast their votes to the electoral college. In this way is a 'winner take all' system.

                This process happens in each state across the country, as well as in
                The District of Columbia. Each slate of electors casts their votes and the winner
                of the election is determined as soon as a party receives over 50% of the electoral
                votes, or 270 electoral votes.

            <p class="content-text">
              It is important to note that while FPTP has it's benefits as a voting system,
              mainly being that it is <b>quick, easy, decently proportional, and commonly
              produces centrist policies</b>. However it also has rather large negative side
              effects associated with it.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              First Past the Post has been repeatedly shown to <b>converge to a two party
              system</b> over multiple election cycles. For example, if there were multiple
              parties in an election, like in the first small multiple below, the lowest
              winning party members might feel that their votes were wasted and a party
              they didn't want to win won the highest, <b>the next year they voted with
              the highest party that most resembles their party values</b> in order to at least
              have a decent say in they way they think the country should head towards.
            </p>
            <p class="content-text">
              This cycle of the lowest winning party not feeling like their votes were worth
              anything dropping and adding their votes to the highest winning party that they
              most align with repeats over and over again until there are a very limited,
              usually two parties left that represent a wide array of individuals in the country.
              This is what also <b>forces FPTP to form centrist policies, with only two parties,
              each party has to cater to a large, non-homogenious group of the population,
              so each party has to form centrist policies in order to make sure they have a
              chance at winning again next election cycle</b>.
